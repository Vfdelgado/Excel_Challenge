# Project Title: Crowdfunding Data Analysis

Project Overview:
This Excel file contains an analysis of crowdfunding data from a specific platform. It includes information about campaigns, outcomes, funding goals, categories, and dates.

Completed Tasks:

1. Conditional Formatting:

Applied to the "Outcome" column to distinguish different outcomes visually.
Applied to the "Percent Funded" column to highlight specific funding levels.

2. Column Creation:

Created new columns for percent funded, average donation, category, sub-category, date created conversion, and date ended conversion.

3. Pivot Tables and Stacked Column Charts:

Constructed a pivot table to count campaign outcomes per category.
Generated a stacked column pivot chart for visualizing outcomes filtered by country.

4. Pivot Tables and Line Graphs:

Developed a pivot table analyzing outcome trends over time, filtered by category and years.
Created a pivot chart line graph to visualize the trends identified in the pivot table.

5. Written Report:

Presented three conclusions drawn from the data.
Identified limitations of the dataset and suggested additional tables or graphs for enhancement.

6. Crowdfunding Goal Analysis:

Calculated percentages of success, failure, or cancellation per goal range.
Created a line chart illustrating the relationship between goal amount and likelihood of success.

7. Statistical Analysis:

Utilized Excel formulas to compute mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation.
Provided a brief justification for selecting mean or median to summarize the dataset.

## Conclusion:

This Excel file offers a comprehensive analysis of crowdfunding data, providing insights into campaign performance, goal analysis, and overall trends within the platform.

## Statistical Analysis Report: 

Mean vs Median		
The Mean better summarizes the data better than the median, as it is used to calculate the average value. The Median in this case doesn't represent the amount of backers for the successful or failed campaigns. 		
		
The standard deviation in the successful backers is higher, so it may seem there is a bigger range in the amount of backers which would factor the success or failure of the campaign. This makes sense beause if there is a great pool of backers, the chances of the campaign beign successful increases.
